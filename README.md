# eCommerce Data Science
### This repository contains the solution for the eCommerce Data Science, which involves analyzing and modeling customer transactions from an eCommerce dataset. The project is divided into three tasks:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): An in-depth analysis of the customer, product, and transaction data to generate valuable business insights.
Lookalike Model: A recommendation model that identifies similar customers based on their transaction history and profile information.
Customer Segmentation: Application of clustering techniques to segment customers into distinct groups based on their transaction patterns and demographic information.
The goal of this project is to extract actionable insights and build predictive models that can help improve business strategies. The notebook files include detailed code for data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
